                <h2>Mission Statement</h2>
                <p>Welcome to Quartz Queen Yoga! My mission is to provide a comfortable environment for all students. Yoga can be a
                personal journey and rather cringe-worthy if you're nervous about attending your first class or even being sweaty around
                others. No worries here, let me guide you through your practice peppered with lame jokes. At QQY I encourage sangha
                (community) and learning. I make time and space for students to ask questions about yoga and connect with other students
                in a personable environment.
                    <br><br>
                The goal of QQY is for everyone to become at peace with your body as I guide you through each Hatha yoga practice,
                whether you’re a first-time yogi or a Yoga Master. By the end of practice, you’ll be ready to hop up, leaving all your
                insecurities on the mat.</p>
